# Lab3
In this laboratory work I've used inheritance to continue the second lab. I use different types of inheritance, like Single inheritance, Multi-level inheritance and hierarchical inheritance. I studied and learned that multiple inheritance is forbidden in java, therefore it can be used only with interfaces.
For inheritance I used the "extends" syntax and chose the subclass to extend the main class, and so on.
Client class is a subclass for a lot of classes, like deposit, loan and others. 
In the end, it was a very interesting topic to learn for oop, as it is one of the 3 most important principles for oop.
